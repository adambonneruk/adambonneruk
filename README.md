## Interesting Configurations
I like to use Git for more than _just_ code. Below is a small collection of public configurations I share for those who might want inspiration. All of which are MIT Licenced; feel free to use and adapt for your own purposes!
| Preview | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adambonneruk/config-network/master/.screenshots/htop-temp.png" width=128px> | [Config-Network](https://github.com/adambonneruk/config-network): This project is used to store my active docker-compose configuration running on a Raspberry Pi 4 (utilising a PoE hat) whilst also serving as a future reference and guide for anyone wanting to do something similar. This Project combines [Unifi](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker), [PiHole](https://hub.docker.com/u/pihole/) and [OpenSpeedTest](https://hub.docker.com/u/openspeedtest#!).
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adambonneruk/config-powershell/master/.screenshot/preview.png" width=256px> | [Config-PowerShell](https://github.com/adambonneruk/config-powershell): My Windows PowerShell configuration, including posh-git and useful functions/aliases, I spend a lot of time in the Windows Terminal so having this configuration (publicly) available for different machines is useful. |

## My FOSS Software Projects
Written mainly in Python and compiled with PyInstaller, my FOSS projects are licenced under the standard MIT Licence. Which in the words of Simon Tatham: _"This means that you can do pretty much anything you like with the binaries or the code, except pretending you wrote them yourself, or suing me if anything goes wrong."_
