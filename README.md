## My FOSS Software Projects
Here is a quick summary for some of the FOSS code i've written as personal projects. All licenced under MIT, which in the words of Simon Tatham ; _"means that you can do pretty much anything you like with the binaries or the code, except pretending you wrote them yourself, or suing me if anything goes wrong"_.

| Icon | Name | Tech Demo | Description |
| :---: | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
| <img src=".images/pinball.png" width=128px> | [Space Cadet Pinball](https://github.com/adambonneruk/space-cadet-pinball) | NSIS | **Want to Play the Windows XP classic on modern Windows 10?**<br> This repository combines public domain files with k4zmu2a's decompilation for the best classic pinball action on newer versions of Windows. Wrapping everything together in an easy-to-use portable installer. |
| <img src=".images/nope.png" width=128px> | [Nope](https://github.com/adambonneruk/nope) | Docker<br>Dive | **Explaining how Docker Works?**<br> This is a purposefully small and simple repository seeking to demonstrate how containers work by leveraging the publicly-maintained httpd image and inserting some .html code. The project then runs the image and inspects it with Dive |
| <img src=".images/awake.png" width=128px> | [Awake](https://github.com/adambonneruk/awake) | Python<br>tkinter<br>threading | **When you can't afford to let Windows lock?**<br> This repository keeps a machine/workstation from going idle. Impersonates a human being continually pressing the scroll lock key ~2 times a second. |
| <img src=".images/unique.png" width=128px> | [UUID Generator](https://github.com/adambonneruk/uuid-generator) | Python tkinter | **Where can I generate some UUIDs?**<br> This repository is a command-line and graphical user interface UUID generator tool written in Python. Generates UUID Versions 1, 3, 4, 5, and 0. Support for DNS, URL, OID, and X.500 Namespaces as well as URN (RFC 4122) prefixes. |
| <img src=".images/watch.png" width=128px> | [Watch](https://github.com/adambonneruk/watch) | Python | **How to watch what's happening in a directory?<br>** This repository watches a given directory, printing out all the contents and refreshing automatically, I use it in demo's to show the impact code changes can have on a Windows directory. |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adambonneruk/transpose-dsv/master/icon/design/256.png" width=128px> | [Transpose DSV](https://github.com/adambonneruk/transpose-dsv) | Python | **Transpose the Columns and Rows in a huge CSV file?**<br> This repository is a tiny python application used to transpose huge delimiter-separated values (including .csv/comma-separated values) via the command line.
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adambonneruk/phone-num-split/documentation/icon/256.png" width=128px> | [Phone Number Split](https://github.com/adambonneruk/phone-num-split) | Python | **Split a UK Telephone Number into Area Code and Local Number**<br> This repository phone-number-split lets you do that at the command line, using pattern matching and some cleaning logic to turn most sequences of numbers into the usual groupings |
| <img src=".images/dts2flac.png" width=128px> | [dts2flac](https://github.com/adambonneruk/phone-num-split) | Python<br>ffmpeg | **Convert Multi-Channel DTS in to FLAC format**<br> Scan a given director for *.dts files and convert to regular *.flac preserving all channels enabling, playback on a wide-variety of devices. |

## My Interesting Configurations
Using git for more programming projects exclusively, here are a couple of useful configurations I use to make my life easier!

| Preview | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adambonneruk/config-network/master/.screenshots/htop-temp.png" width=256px> | [Config-Network](https://github.com/adambonneruk/config-network): This project is used to store my active docker-compose configuration running on a Raspberry Pi 4 (utilising a PoE hat) whilst also serving as a future reference and guide for anyone wanting to do something similar. This Project combines [Unifi](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker), [PiHole](https://hub.docker.com/u/pihole/) and [OpenSpeedTest](https://hub.docker.com/u/openspeedtest#!).
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adambonneruk/config-powershell/master/.screenshot/preview.png" width=256px> | [Config-PowerShell](https://github.com/adambonneruk/config-powershell): My Windows PowerShell configuration, including posh-git and some functions/aliases, I spend a lot of time in the Windows Terminal so having this configuration available for different machines is useful. |
