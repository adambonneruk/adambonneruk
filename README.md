#### My Repositories
Here is a quick summary for some of the FOSS code i've written as personal projects. All licenced under MIT, which in the words of Simon Tatham ; _"means that you can do pretty much anything you like with the binaries or the code, except pretending you wrote them yourself, or suing me if anything goes wrong"_.
