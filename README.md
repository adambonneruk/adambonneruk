## Interesting Configurations
I like to use Git for more than _just_ code. Below is a small collection of public configurations I share for those who might want inspiration. All of which are MIT Licenced; feel free to use and adapt for your own purposes!

This Project combines [Unifi](https://github.com/jacobalberty/unifi-docker), [PiHole](https://hub.docker.com/u/pihole/) and [OpenSpeedTest](https://hub.docker.com/u/openspeedtest#!).

## My FOSS Software Projects
Written mainly in Python and compiled with PyInstaller, my FOSS projects are licenced under the standard MIT Licence. Which in the words of Simon Tatham: _"This means that you can do pretty much anything you like with the binaries or the code, except pretending you wrote them yourself, or suing me if anything goes wrong."_
